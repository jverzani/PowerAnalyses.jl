    StatisticalTest

Supertype for all test types in this package.

The lowest level types are all structs because some of them need to hold values.
A parameter can become a struct field when it's never required to infer the parameter from the other parameters.
For example, it doesn't make sense to use a power analysis to check whether one should use a one tailed or two tailed t-test.
As another example, it does make sense to use a power analysis to check the required sample size `n` (an a priori power analysis).

See the G*Power 3 paper for many parameters and noncentrality parameters
(https://doi.org/10.3758/BF03193146).

The huge collection of types isn't making this code very pretty.
Unfortunately, it seems to be a requirement when working in the frequentist world.
